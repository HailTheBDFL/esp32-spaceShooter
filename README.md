# esp32-spaceShooter
A crappy remix of Space Invaders, basically. Open in Arduino IDE, having installed https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32.

Made this one night instead of sleeping. The sleep deprivation shows itself in the spaghetti code. It is a *functional* game, technically, but some of the features I tried to implement simply didn't work. Their remnants are strewn about in the project. Another issue is that I made my own routine for drawing bitmaps that allows multiple colors, but it is terribly wasteful of memory and time. Could be fixed, can't be bothered.
